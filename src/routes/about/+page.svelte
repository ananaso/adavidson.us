	<p class="text-lg">Hello there! My name's Alden Davidson, this is my personal website!</p>

	<p>
		For the last 4+ years I've been an officer in United States Space Force/Air Force at Los Angeles
		Air Force Base. During that time, I've had the privilege to become a <a
			href="https://supracoders.us/">Supra Coder</a
		> and this jumpstarted my journey into full-stack software development.
	</p>

	<p>
		I'm now in the process of transitioning to private industry in August 2024. Currently I'm doing
		a SkillBridge internship with <a href="https://www.growsagely.com/">Sagely</a> as a software engineer
		helping them create an outstanding tool for organizing and guiding folks' learning journeys - and
		doing my own learning journey into how modern commercial software is developed!
	</p>

	<p>
		I decided to make this site when I started dabbling in self-hosting stuff for myself, simply as
		another thing to try. It's also, of course, a pretty handy place to organize the stuff I'm
		working on in a central location with more flexibility than what's possible on many other sites.
	</p>

	<p class="relative top-48 text-xs">
		...and yes, I did shamelessly base this site's skeleton off of the <a
			href="https://github.com/svelte-add/svelte-add">Svelte Add</a
		> demo site ðŸ˜„

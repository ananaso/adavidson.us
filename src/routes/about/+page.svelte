<div class="text-column">
	<h1>Hello there!</h1>

	<h2>
		My name's Alden Davidson, welcome to my personal website!
	</h2>

	<button class="btn btn-primary">test</button>

	<p>
		I decided to make this site when I started dabbling in self-hosting stuff for myself, simply as another thing to try.
		It's also, of course, a pretty handy place to advertise the stuff I'm working on in a central location with more flexibility than what's possible on many other sites.
